            <h2>Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals</h2>

            <h3>Course details</h3>
            Continue your coding journey as you dive deeper into the foundational concepts, practices, and terminology
            of
            programming. In this installment of the Programming Foundations series, instructor Sasha Vodnik goes beyond
            the
            basics, using Python to tackle a variety of intermediate and advanced concepts and skills you can add to
            your
            programming repertoire. Sasha covers creating and working with collections and loops, combining, and
            manipulating strings, and using external code—all of which are critical concepts, regardless of which
            programming language you end up working with. He goes over several essential processes, such as choosing a
            code
            style and debugging. Plus, he digs into a few more advanced concepts, including memory management and
            multithreading.
